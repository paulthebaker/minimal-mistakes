    "# Wavelet Denoising: a basic demonstration\n",

    "This is a conceptual demonstration of the `FastBurst` algorithm to find gravitational wave (GW) bursts in LIGO data.\n",
    "This analysis uses no *a priori* knowledge of GW waveforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several GW burst searches performed on real LIGO data including Coherent Wave Burst (`cWB`), `BayesWave`, and `oLIB`.\n",
    "This analysis is simple relative to those three, making it a nice introduction to GW burst searching.\n",
    "Do to its simplicity, the `FastBurst` algorithm is computationally cheap.\n",
    "It is meant to act as a *first pass* analysis to find times of interest to be analysed by the much more sophisticated and computationally expensive `BayesWave` pipeline.\n",
    "The production level `FastBurst` code is written in `C`, and is being developed for large scale runs on LIGO data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration will walk you through the basics of wavelet denoising, using a simulated signal.\n",
    "A second notebook, `coherent_wavelet_denoising.ipynb`, will walk you through the process of **coherent wavelet denoising**, which is used in the `FastBurst` algorithm.\n",
    "Finally, a third notebook, `FastBurst_for_LOSC.ipynb`, calls functions from the `fastburst` module to perform the coherent wavelet denoising analysis on real data from the LIGO Open Science Center (LOSC).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    " * This notebook has been tested in `Python2.7` and `Python3.5`.\n",
    " * It depends on `numpy` and `matplotlib`.\n",
    " * It uses the provided `wavelet` module for wavelet transforms (which depends on `scipy`)"
