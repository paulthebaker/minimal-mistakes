Hello!

I'm Paul T Baker.
I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology][gwac] at West Virginia University.  I study gravitational waves.  Particularly I'm interested in methods to detect and characterize gravitational waves.
Before coming to WVU I was a visiting assistant professor at SUNY Geneseo, a public liberal arts college that is home to one of the largest all undergrad physics departments in the country.

I study gravitational wave data analysis techniques.
I've worked on [LIGO][ligo] since 2007, and more recently have worked on detecting gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays (PTA).
I'm now a member of [NANOGrav][nano], the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational waves, which seeks to detect low frequecy gravitational waves by timing radio pulsars.
NANOGrav is one of three PTAs that jointly form the [International Pulsar Timing Array][ipta].

Over my life, I've lived in New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Montana, and now West Virginia.
